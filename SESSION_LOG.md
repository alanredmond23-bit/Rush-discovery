## Key Strategy Points

### Continuance Targets
- **PRIMARY:** 12 months (April 2027)
- **FALLBACK:** 6 months (October 2026)
- **FLOOR:** 90 days (walk-away minimum)

### Precedent to Cite
- January 6 Capitol cases: 17-40 TB = 12-24 month delays
- US v. Gordon: Hundreds of thousands of docs = complexity upheld
- US v. Lewis: 90 days excludable for voluminous discovery
- US v. Sayler: Can't dump 600K docs and claim Brady compliance
- US v. Bagley: Brady must be disclosed months before trial, not days

### Mathematical Argument
- Millions of WAV files × 3x real-time review = impossible in months
- Government had 2.5 years to investigate; defense has had months
- Our discovery volume EXCEEDS January 6 cases

## Meeting Objectives (January 14, 2026)

1. **GET CONTINUANCE** - As long as possible (12 months target)
2. **FEEL OUT POSITION** - Intel gathering on their trial posture
3. **MAKE NERVOUS** - Signal Groff credibility concerns without revealing attack
4. **WORKLOAD BOMB** - Demand Brady/Giglio/302s/agent notes

### Critical Rules for Rush
- NO PROFFER under any circumstances
- NO sharing client's version of events
- NO concessions on intent, knowledge, control, or harm
- NO revealing Franks attack or Groff impeachment specifics
